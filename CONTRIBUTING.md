## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Basic understanding of React, TypeScript, and Supabase

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/yourusername/chamalink.git
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chamalink.git
   cd chamalink
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```

4. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**
   - Open <http://localhost:5173>
   - Create a test account

## üõ† Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes

### Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Write code following our standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation

3. **Commit Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user authentication with M-PESA verification"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(auth): add M-PESA phone verification
fix(loans): resolve calculation error in interest rates
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(components): format SavingsCard component
refactor(api): simplify M-PESA integration logic
test(utils): add unit tests for validation functions
chore(deps): update React to v18.3.1
```

## üîç Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

5. **Merge**: Approved PRs are merged by maintainers

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

```typescript
// Good
interface ChamaGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  memberCount: number;
  currentAmount: number;
}

// Avoid
const group: any = { ... };
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed
- Follow single responsibility principle

```typescript
// Good
const SavingsCard: React.FC<SavingsCardProps> = ({ group, onContribute }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleContribution = useCallback(async (amount: number) => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      await onContribute(amount);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Contribution failed:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [onContribute]);

  return (
    <Card>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </Card>
  );
};
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use semantic class names
- Maintain consistent spacing

```tsx
// Good
<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
    Chama Details
  </h2>
</div>
```

### State Management

- Use React Query for server state
- Use local component state for UI state
- Use context sparingly for global state

```typescript
// Good - Server state with React Query
const { data: groups, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['chama-groups', userId],
  queryFn: () => fetchUserGroups(userId),
  enabled: !!userId
});

// Good - Local UI state
const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows (planned)

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Component test example
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { SavingsCard } from './SavingsCard';

describe('SavingsCard', () => {
  it('should display group information', () => {
    const mockGroup = {
      id: '1',
      name: 'Test Chama',
      currentAmount: 10000,
      targetAmount: 50000
    };

    render(<SavingsCard group={mockGroup} onContribute={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Chama')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('KSh 10,000')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Write clear, descriptive comments
- Document complex business logic
- Use JSDoc for functions and components

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the monthly payment for a loan based on principal, interest rate, and term
 * @param principal - The loan amount in KSh
 * @param annualRate - Annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 5 for 5%)
 * @param termMonths - Loan term in months
 * @returns Monthly payment amount in KSh
 */
const calculateMonthlyPayment = (
  principal: number,
  annualRate: number,
  termMonths: number
): number => {
  // Implementation
};
```
